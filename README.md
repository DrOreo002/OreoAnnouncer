Why is this open source?. Because I want people to contribute something and make changes.
Btw if you want to build this on your IDE. You'll need PlaceholderAPI as a dependency and the PaginationOreo-Public. You'll also need to change some of the method as well, because I obfs the PaginationOreo-Public. Why?, my friend want me to do it, because he work hard for it
