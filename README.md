# OreoAnnouncer
Simple announcer for minecraft bukkit / spigot server

Why is this open source?. Because github has things called Issues. so i can keep track of issue that is available.

Btw if you want to build this on your IDE. You'll need PlaceholderAPI as a dependency and the PaginationOreo-Public. You'll also need to change some of the method as well, because I obfs the PaginationOreo-Public. Why?, my friend want me to do it, because he work hard for it

PS : This github is not intended to be easy to build.
